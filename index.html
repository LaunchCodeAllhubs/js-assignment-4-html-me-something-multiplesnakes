       <p>I went back there again. It felt like eyes were following me, but I didn't see the guy. I did get some pictures, though. Some of them didnt turn out really great. There are some really cool trees out there. A cop almost caught me, but I don't think he really cared. There's this creepy kind of atmosphere out here. It's like being in a dream, especially at night.</p></div></div></section></article>

       <p>Every time I try to visit the mansion, it feels like I have to take a new road. I came in from Spruce Ave this time, but I remember going in from Lake Ave last time and don't think there was another road away. It led up to the front of the mansion again, though, and I didn't see any cops this time.</p></div></div></section></article>

       This guy is such a bad liar, there isn't even a Spruce Ave anywhere around the mansion. </div></section></article>

       I found something weird outside of the mansion, near the side door with the broken concrete steps. Don't even want to think about it might be. The night was unusually cold, and when I went in there it was really warm. Like a fire was going in the big fireplace. But it was as dark and empty as usual. I noticed one of the chairs was moved around. I didn't think anyone but I could get in here. Who was it? </div></div></section></article>

       I was chased!!! I saw him, it looked like he was wearing a hood and maybe thick glassses - I didn't really get a good look at him and just booked it into the mansion, through the storm cellar doors. It's freezing in here, and it's the middle of summer. I can't really see anything. My cellphone batteries are dying. This might be the last post I send to you.</div></div></section></article>
